    "How can a musician improve their music using statistics? Tackling such a subjective matter with objective strategies walks a fine line that, without the proper precautions, is bound to produce undesired results. Appealing to the lowest common denominator is not the proper way to build a loyal audience. In fact, doing so often produces the exact opposite result. By trying to make a 'one size fits all' you will end up making a 'one size fits none'.\n",

    "My goal with this project isn't to make sweeping generalizations about music as a whole or provide some magical formula for the perfect song. It doesn't take a musician to know such a goal is impossible. The goal is to take into account the idea that 'art is limitation' and provide a narrowed set of attributes, both technical and not, that a musician may use to guide their creative process, if they so choose. Additionally, artists may look at their current discography to see which songs they alrady have that fit into the picture extracted from this data, potentially giving a fresh way to market older music."

    "In order to delineate a clear set of attributes, I will be taking a certain set of songs, namely songs coming from playlists with 'running' or 'study' in the title, and comparing them to a random selection of songs meant to represent the general population. ([Running](https://github.com/0-b1t/spotify_insights/blob/master/data/running_playlist_tracks.csv), [Study](https://github.com/0-b1t/spotify_insights/blob/master/data/study_playlist_tracks.csv), [Population](https://github.com/0-b1t/spotify_insights/blob/master/data/sampled_set.csv))\n",

    "All of the data was gathered using of Spotify's web api, a music streaming app that has nearly 300 million monthly [listeners](https://deadline.com/2020/07/spotifys-q2-montly-active-users-jump-29-to-299-million-podcast-engagement-grows-but-losses-widen-stock-dips-1202998233/). Fortunately, Spotify provides a diverse set of standardized, numerical metrics for not just technical aspects, like tempo, key, meter, and loudness, but also non-technical things, like valence (mood), energy, and speechiness. In-depth explanation of each attribute can be found in the API's [reference](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/). Additionally, [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.12.0/#), a Python library, was used to access the web API. The data for the running and study playlists was generated by my own code and the random sampling was taken from a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks) set of over 160,000 songs."

    "### The Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be using standard t-tests on normally distributed, independent data i.e. tempo, energy, and valence. Expanding on that, I will use parametric confidence intervals to make meaningful statements on the differences between the data. For non-normal, independent data, I will be using Mann-Whitney U tests to determine statistical significance between categories. Moreover, I will use non-parametric confidence intervals, common language effect sizes, and ranked biserial coefficients to, again, make meaningful observations about the data."
